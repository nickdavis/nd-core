# ND Core Plugin

Github project link: https://github.com/nickdavis/nd-core

This plugin is designed to be used as a core functionality plugin for all https://iamnickdavis.com clients.

Itâ€™s designed to be used as a general, rather than project specific plugin.

For example, if I added a new function designed to disable some piece of Yoast SEO functionality (a plugin used on many client sites) I would add it to ND Core, where it is likely to benefit all clients, than any project specific, core functionality plugin.

On that note, most projects will also have a [Project Name] Core plugin as well where project specific functionality is added (and any unwanted ND Core functionality can be disabled or overridden).

Finally, ND Core is designed to work with the latest version of the ND Starter theme (https://github.com/nickdavis/nd-starter) and the Genesis Framework parent theme (http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/). Without these, ND Core functionality may be limited.

## Installation Instructions

1. Upload the ND Core theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Plugins.
3. Activate the ND Core plugin.

## Plugin Support

You are free to use this plugin for your own project, but support is only provided to https://iamnickdavis.com clients.
